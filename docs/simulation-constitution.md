Simulation Constitution
1. Purpose

This simulation models how cross-functional decisions interact over time inside a single organisation.
The objective is not to “win” but to expose trade-offs between growth, risk, resilience, and legitimacy under uncertainty.

It is designed as:

an MBA capstone experience

a senior management capability and upskilling tool

Learning occurs through consequences, not content delivery.

2. The Organisation

A mid-size, multinational, technology-enabled consumer products firm launching a new AI-augmented product across multiple markets.

The firm faces:

volatile demand

supply chain fragility

regulatory scrutiny

capital constraints

reputational exposure

All scenarios are variations of this core organisation.

3. Roles

Each participant occupies one role only with asymmetric information and authority.

Strategy: sets direction, allocates strategic investment, accepts or defers major risks

Marketing: drives demand, pricing, positioning, and growth signals

Product & Supply: manages production capacity, suppliers, quality, and delivery risk

R&D: controls innovation pace, product maturity, and technical debt

Sales: converts demand into revenue under incentives and constraints

Legal & Regulatory: manages compliance, exposure, and licence to operate

General Management: arbitrates conflicts and resolves deadlocks

No role sees the full system.

4. Decisions

Decisions are:

discrete

role-specific

irreversible or costly to reverse

Examples include:

capital allocation

pricing strategy

supplier selection

launch timing

compliance posture

Decisions trigger second- and third-order effects.

5. System State

The simulation tracks a persistent organisational state, including:

financial performance

risk accumulation

operational resilience

regulatory exposure

reputation

State evolves continuously, not in neat rounds.

6. Shocks

External shocks occur probabilistically, influenced by prior decisions.

Examples:

supply disruption

regulatory intervention

competitor moves

public trust events

Shocks are not random punishment. They reveal hidden fragilities.

7. Learning Outcomes

Participants should leave with:

an understanding of cross-functional interdependence

improved decision quality under uncertainty

awareness of unintended consequences

the ability to explain why outcomes occurred

Assessment focuses on reasoning, not just results.

8. Non-Goals

This simulation is not:

a financial spreadsheet game

a UI-heavy toy

a deterministic optimisation problem

Complexity is purposeful, not decorative.
