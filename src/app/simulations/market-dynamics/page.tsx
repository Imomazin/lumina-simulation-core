  content: `You are the CEO of Velocity Software, a mid-sized enterprise software company.

For three years, you've held steady at 18% market share—respectable, but not dominant. NexTech leads with 31%. Two other players, Pinnacle and Crest, hold 22% and 15% respectively. A scrappy startup called Disrupt.io has been gaining ground with aggressive pricing.

The enterprise software market is worth $4.2 billion annually and growing 8% per year. But growth is slowing, and competition is intensifying. Every point of market share you gain comes from someone else's pocket.

Your board has made their expectations clear: grow share to 25% within two years, or they'll consider "strategic alternatives." Translation: they'll sell the company.

Your competitors are watching. Your customers are negotiating. Your salesforce is hungry.

Welcome to market warfare.`,

The fiscal year begins. Your sales pipeline is healthy but competitive pressure is rising.

Market intelligence reports:
• NexTech is doubling down on enterprise, hiring 50 new sales reps
• Pinnacle appears defensive, focused on retention
• Disrupt.io is burning cash to acquire SMB customers at any cost

Your CFO reminds you: "Market share gains that destroy margin aren't wins. They're slow-motion suicide."

How will you compete?`,
    competitorMoves: `NexTech increased enterprise sales investment. Pinnacle launched customer success initiative. Disrupt.io cut prices by 15% in SMB.`,
  },
  2: {
    briefing: `**QUARTER 2: PRESSURE BUILDS**

Last quarter's moves are showing results—some good, some concerning.

Your largest customer's contract is up for renewal in Q3, and Pinnacle is circling. Sales reports: "Deals are getting harder. Win rates are down 8 points."

The board wants an update on your path to 25% share.`,
    competitorMoves: `NexTech held pricing but increased service levels. Crest launched vertical-specific product. Disrupt.io raised $50M in new funding.`,
  },
  3: {
    briefing: `**QUARTER 3: THE FIRST CRISIS**

A market event has reshaped the landscape. Your assumptions from Q1 may no longer hold.

Your head of sales reports: "A major RFP has landed—$5M deal that could shift share by a full point. But winning requires aggressive pricing."

Every competitor is watching what you do next.`,
    competitorMoves: `All competitors responding to market disruption. Strategies in flux.`,
  },
  4: {
    briefing: `**QUARTER 4: YEAR-END PRESSURE**

Q4. Deals need to close. Numbers need to hit.

Your CFO: "We're tracking to plan, but share gains are modest. The board expected more."

Intelligence suggests NexTech is preparing a major product announcement for next quarter.`,
    competitorMoves: `NexTech focusing on closing enterprise deals. Everyone pushing for Q4 numbers.`,
  },
  5: {
    briefing: `**QUARTER 5: YEAR TWO BEGINS**

Year two of your mandate. The board's patience is wearing thin.

A private equity firm has reached out to your board. "Exploratory," they said. But nothing is exploratory at this stage.

You need a breakthrough quarter.`,
    competitorMoves: `Competitors sense blood in the water. Aggressive moves across the board.`,
  },
  6: {
    briefing: `**QUARTER 6: THE COUNTERSTRIKE**

Your competitors have responded to your year-two push. The market is more competitive than ever.

Disrupt.io is moving upmarket—targeting your mid-market stronghold. NexTech has launched a competitive displacement program targeting Velocity customers.

This is the quarter where strategies either succeed or collapse.`,
    competitorMoves: `Full competitive assault from multiple directions.`,
  },
  7: {
    briefing: `**QUARTER 7: THE RECKONING**

Seven quarters in. The board meets next month for final assessment.

One major customer has churned. Two more are "evaluating options." But you've also won three significant new logos.

The narrative could go either way.`,
    competitorMoves: `Competitors consolidating positions. Some winning; others wounded.`,
  },
  8: {
    briefing: `**QUARTER 8: FINAL QUARTER**

The final quarter. The board meets in 90 days to decide Velocity's future.

Market share, profitability, competitive position—it all comes down to this.

What's your final move?`,
    competitorMoves: `End-game positioning by all competitors.`,
