const COMPANY_STORY = {
  name: 'Titan Industrial Holdings',
  industry: 'Industrial Manufacturing & Technology',
  situation: `You are Marcus Chen, newly appointed CFO of Titan Industrial Holdings, a $2.8B industrial conglomerate.

Your predecessor left suddenly after a whistleblower revealed aggressive revenue recognition practices. The restatement wiped $180M from last year's earnings, and the SEC is circling.

The company has 18 months of runway, but storm clouds are gathering: a major customer representing 22% of revenue is reviewing the relationship, credit rating agencies have you on negative watch, and an activist investor has been quietly accumulating shares.

Your mandate from the board: stabilize the finances, restore creditor confidence, and avoid bankruptcy. The previous CFO made promises the company can't keep. Now you must decide which ones to break.`,

  cfoBackground: `Former investment banker at Goldman Sachs, you joined for the challenge of a turnaround. You've seen companies survive worse—and you've seen them fail. The difference is always in the decisions made under pressure.`,
