const COMPANY_STORY = {
  name: 'Apex Software',
  industry: 'Enterprise SaaS',
  situation: `You are Jordan Blake, newly appointed VP of Sales at Apex Software, a $85M ARR enterprise SaaS company.

Your predecessor was fired six weeks ago after missing quota for three consecutive quarters. The board has lost patience. Revenue growth has stalled at 12% while competitors are growing 40%+.

The situation you've inherited is fragile:
- 40% of the sales team missed quota last quarter
- Your top performer is interviewing at Salesforce
- Customers are complaining about aggressive upselling tactics
- The pipeline is stuffed with "happy ears" deals that won't close
- Finance is demanding you cut discounts by 50%
- Marketing says sales is wasting all their leads

The CEO gave you eight quarters to turn this around. "Hit the number or we're all out of jobs," she said. No pressure.`,

  vpBackground: `Former enterprise AE who rose through the ranks at Oracle and HubSpot. You've seen what good looks like—and what bad looks like. Apex is somewhere in between, sliding toward bad. Your playbook: build trust, fix fundamentals, then scale. But the board wants results now, not later.`,
